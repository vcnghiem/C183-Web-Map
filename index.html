<h2>Cartographic Notes from Cycling Around Berkeley</h2>
<h4> Since starting at UC Berkeley in August 2024, I have relied almost exclusively on my bicycle(s) to travel to, from, within, and nearby campus. Even after more than a year of cycle-related calamity—one bike theft, one successful bike rescue mission, another bike theft (lamentably, this time without a successful corresponding rescue mission...see button at bottom of page), several bodily injuries, and too many mechanical malfunctions to count—I have come to realize that there is no better way to experience this little square mile or so that I traverse everyday. Seven of the most prominent routes that I have routinely biked are mapped below.</h4>
